# Threads Scraper

Script to download all pictures of a threads profile.

## Download

Be sure to clone the repository recusrively so the submodules get also cloned:
git clone --recursive https://github.com/baltermia/threads-scraper

## How to Use

Run it like this:
```
py ./src/scraper.py @username
```

The image files should be located in the `./out` directory.

## Note

I do not recommend using this script for scraping threads profiles. The use of web scrapers is generally disallowed by the website's terms of service and can potentially violate legal and ethical guidelines. However, it can be used as an educational tool to understand web scraping concepts and techniques.
